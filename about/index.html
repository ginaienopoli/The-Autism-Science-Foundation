    <title>About</title>

    <p>
      The Autism Science Foundation is a nonprofit corporation organized for
      charitable and educational purposes, and exempt from taxation under
      section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code.
      <br><br>
      The Autism Science Foundation’s mission is to support autism research by
      providing funding and other assistance to scientists and organizations
      conducting, facilitating, publicizing and disseminating autism research.
      The organization also provides information about autism to the general
      public and serves to increase awareness of autism spectrum disorders and
      the needs of individuals and families affected by autism.
      <br><br>
      Our organization adheres to rigorous scientific standards and values.
      We believe that outstanding research is the greatest gift we can offer
      our families. Every research dollar needs to count.
      <br><br>
      The Autism Science Foundation’s mission is premised on the following facts
      and principles:
      <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Autism is known to have a strong genetic component. Research must
              aim to discover the mechanisms of action that trigger autism, as
              well as safe, effective and novel treatments to enhance the
              quality of life for children and adults currently affected.</li>

          <li>Early diagnosis and early intervention are critical to helping
              people with autism reach their potential, but educational,
              vocational and support services must be applied across the
              lifespan. Science has a critical role to play in creating
              evidence-based, effective lifespan interventions.</li>

          <li>Vaccines save lives; they do not cause autism. Numerous studies
              have failed to show a causal link between vaccines and autism.
              Vaccine safety research should continue to be conducted by the
              public health system in order to ensure vaccine safety and
              maintain confidence in our national vaccine program, but further
              investment of limited autism research dollars is not warranted at
              this time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      The Autism Science Foundation is tax exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the
      Internal Revenue Code. Donations are tax-deductible to the full extent
      allowed by law.
