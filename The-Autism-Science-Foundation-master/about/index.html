    <title>About</title>

    <p>
      The Autism Science Foundation’s mission is to support autism research by
      providing funding and other assistance to scientists and organizations
      conducting, facilitating, publicizing and disseminating autism research.
      From their research they have concluded that autism has a strong genetic
      component, early diagnosis and early intervention is critical to help
      people with autism reach their potential, and vaccines do not cause autism.
        <br><br>
      My brother has autism, and they’re not a lot of resources for people with
      autism or family members of the autistic individual. Raising an autistic
      child is more complex than a child without autism. They are sensitive to
      bright colors, loud noises, crowds, types of materials (such as clothing)
      and as a result this foundation gives resources on how to handle tantrums,
      outburst, or things they could buy to help them not be sensitive to these
      things. I also feel like a lot of websites don’t go over people with
      autism going into adulthood, how the caregivers or siblings feel or 
      handling an autistic person. There also toolkits for autistic people going
      to the dentist’s, doctor’s (like getting blood drawn), getting employment,
      improving social interactions, and a guide for being in a military family.
        <br><br>
      People just see autism as a lack of socializing interactions, but they
      have failed to realize that there’s more than that. Thankfully this
      foundation addresses this, and provides guidebooks, toolkits, stores, and
      resources on how to make an autistic person more relaxed and comfortable.
